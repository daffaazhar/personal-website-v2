## Short Explanation

Hexcape is a unique puzzle game that combines a digital experience with physical elements such as cards and a map. Players must work together as a team to progress through the story, which is inspired by Greek mythology and involves helping a girl become a demigod. The game uses various technologies to provide an immersive gaming experience, including QR codes, image recognition, ARKit, RealityKit, and SceneKit.

## Project Goals

As a team of board game lovers, we want to bring our love of board games to the next level by using innovative technologies such as QR codes, image recognition, ARKit, RealityKit, and SceneKit.

Our goal is to create a game that is engaging and immersive, allowing players to feel like they are truly part of the game world as they explore virtual locations, solve puzzles, and make decisions that affect the outcome of the game. We hope to achieve this goal by using a range of technologies to provide a unique and interactive gaming experience that will appeal to players of all ages. Ultimately, the goal of the Hexcape project is to create a game that is both enjoyable and challenging, providing players with an exciting and memorable gaming experience.
